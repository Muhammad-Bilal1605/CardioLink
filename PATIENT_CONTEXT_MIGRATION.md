# Patient Context Migration - Secure Patient ID Management

## Overview
This migration removes patient IDs from URLs and implements a secure context-based approach for managing the current patient throughout the EHR system.

## Key Changes

### 1. Patient Context (`frontend/src/context/PatientContext.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Securely manages the current patient ID and data using React Context
- **Storage**: Uses `sessionStorage` for persistence (cleared when browser closes)
- **Security**: Patient IDs are no longer exposed in URLs

### 2. Updated Routing (`frontend/src/App.jsx`)
- **Before**: `/upload-imaging/:patientId`, `/ehr?patientId=123`
- **After**: `/upload-imaging`, `/ehr`
- **Benefit**: Clean URLs without sensitive patient information

### 3. Component Updates
All EHR-related components now use the context instead of URL parameters:
- `PatientList.jsx` - Sets active patient when clicking on a patient
- `PatientImagingList.jsx` - Sets active patient for imaging uploads
- `PatientLabResultsList.jsx` - Sets active patient for lab result uploads
- `EHR.jsx` - Gets patient ID from context, redirects if none selected
- `UploadImaging.jsx` - Uses context for patient ID
- `UploadLabResults.jsx` - Uses context for patient ID
- `LeftRow1.jsx` - Gets patient data from context
- `CurrentMedications.jsx` - Uses context for patient ID

### 4. Navigation Utility (`frontend/src/utils/patientNavigation.js`)
- Provides secure navigation helpers
- Ensures patient context is set before navigation
- Centralized navigation logic

### 5. Role-Based Patient Selection
- **Doctors**: Use `/patients` for EHR access and `/patient-visits` for visit uploads
- **Radiologists**: Use `/patient-imaging` for imaging uploads
- **Lab Technologists**: Use `/patient-lab-results` for lab result uploads
- **Hospital Front Desk**: Use `/patient-procedures` for procedure uploads and `/patient-hospitalizations` for hospitalization uploads
